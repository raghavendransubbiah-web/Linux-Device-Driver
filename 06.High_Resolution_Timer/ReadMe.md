A basic Linux device driver which explains about the kernel timer in Linux device driver.



\##write up for High resolution timer###



High-resolution timers are needed in embedded systems for tasks that require very precise timing, such as digital power control, motor control, and high-speed data capture. 

They provide the necessary fine granularity for applications like adjusting the duty cycle of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, controlling resonant converters, or ensuring accurate timing for sensors and communication protocols, which cannot be achieved with standard timers.
